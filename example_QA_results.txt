------------------------------
DETAILED FINDINGS
------------------------------

1. Statistical Analysis
   • During the Growth regime (2016-2019), Tech and Industrial sectors had a strong positive correlation of 0.714.

2. Statistical Analysis
   • During the Shock regime (2020-present), this correlation weakened to 0.583.

3. Causal Analysis
   • Tigramite analysis shows that changes in GDP growth rate (r=0.75) and consumer confidence (r=0.68) were key drivers of the Tech-Industrial correlation during the Growth regime.
   • During the Shock regime, these factors' influence weakened (GDP: r=0.42, Consumer Confidence: r=0.31), contributing to the reduced correlation.
